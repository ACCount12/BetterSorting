This mod changes equipment sorting to prioritize what's important to most players and cut down on unnecessary scrolling. Here's the new salvage/shop sorting order:

 1. LosTech
 2. Mechs (sorted by tonnage)
 3. Mech parts (sorted by tonnage)
 4. Upgrades
 5. Rare "heat sinks": heat banks, etc
 6. Improved weapons
 7. Generic weapons
 8. Generic ammo
 9. Generic jump jets
 10. Generic heat sinks

Mech lab inventory is sorted by:

 1. Category 
 2. Type.
 3. Manufacturer
 4. Rarity
