## Changes

This mod changes equipment sorting to prioritize what's important to most players and cut down on unnecessary scrolling. Here's the new sorting order:

 1. LosTech
 2. Mechs
 3. Mech parts
 4. Upgrades
 5. Rare "heat sinks": heat banks, etc
 6. Improved weapons
 7. Generic weapons
 8. Generic ammo
 9. Generic jump jets
 10. Generic heat sinks

Mechs and mech parts are sorted by tonnage in shops, but not on the salvage screen. If you know how to fix this, feel free to make a PR.
